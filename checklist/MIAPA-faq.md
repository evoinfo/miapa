The first reconciled draft checklist was created by [the participants](http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/MIAPAWorkshop2011#Participants) of the 2011 TDWG workshop (see below).

This github repository was created by [Karen Cranston](http://github.com/kcranston) and [Hilmar Lapp](http://github.com/hlapp)

History
-------

* The publication by [Leebens-Mack et al (2006), "Taking the first steps towards a standard for reporting on phylogenies: Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA)"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/omi.2006.10.231), was the first articulating the need and vision for MIAPA, though it not propose an actual checklist, vocabulary, or ontology.
* The workshop "Steps towards a Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis (MIAPA) Standard", held at the 2011 TDWG Conference in New Orleans, LA, resulted in the [first draft checklist](http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/Phylogenetics/MIAPADraft#Reconciled_draft_checklist).
* At the [2nd Phylotastic Hackathon](http://evoio.org/wiki/Phylotastic_II), a group worked on several targets towards advancing MIAPA, including a MIAPA ontology and this version-tracked evolvable form of the checklist.
